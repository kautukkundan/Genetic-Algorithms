# Genetic-Algorithms

Genetic algorithms are optimization algorithms that are based on the principle of "survival of the fittest". This algorithm is a nature inspired algorithm which can be used to find the optimal solution of any problem set by creating a pool of similar looking solutions with slight differences and picking the best fit from that particular lot and repeating the steps by choosing the fittest solution as the starting point of the next population. The basic concepts involved in this approach are: 
1. Initialization (creation of the gene pool)
2. Selection (choosing the fittest gene)
3. Crossover (using the fittest genes to create children)
4. Mutation (Introducing slight random changes to each child)
